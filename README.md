# kaccumulation
Model of a STN axon with k+ accumulation. See Bellinger et. al. 2008

This repository is used for keeping track of modifications to the simulation environment while using the original model to see the effect KHFAC (kilohertz frequency alternating current) extracellular stimulation has. The original paper discusses using a range of frequencies from 10-300Hz and can cause block after prolonged periods of activation.
